# A Portfolio Built Using React and React Bootstrap

## OBjective

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive, professional portfolio web app using React. The portfolio showcases some of my work, and links to my professional profiles including my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. 


* Please note that this is deployed to Heroku and not GitHub pages because I have an existing GitHub pages account I didn't want to modify.
